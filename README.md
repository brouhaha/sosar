# sosutil - utility to manipulate SOS and ProDOS disk images

Hosted at the
[sosutil Github repository](https://github.com/brouhaha/sosutil/).

## Introduction

Introduced in 1980, the SOS operating system for the Apple /// used a
hierarchical file system, a significant improvement over the flat
filesystems used on the Apple II (by Apple DOS, Apple Pascal, and
CP/M).

In 1983, Apple introduced the ProDOS operating system for the Apple II
family, intended to replace Apple DOS. ProDOS used the same filesystem
as SOS.

sosutil is intended to provide a command line interface to manipulate
SOS and ProDOS disk image files. As of this writing, sosutil is only
capable of printing the directory of such a disk image file.
