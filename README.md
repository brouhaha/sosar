# sosar - utility to manipulate SOS and ProDOS disk images

Hosted at the
[sosar Github repository](https://github.com/brouhaha/sosar/).

## Introduction

Introduced in 1980, the SOS operating system for the Apple /// used a
hierarchical file system, a significant improvement over the flat
filesystems used on the Apple II (by Apple DOS, Apple Pascal, and
CP/M).

In 1983, Apple introduced the ProDOS operating system for the Apple II
family, intended to replace Apple DOS. ProDOS used the same filesystem
as SOS.

sosar (pronounced like "saucer") is intended to provide a command line
interface to manipulate SOS and ProDOS disk image files. As of this
writing, sosar is only capable of printing the directory of such a
disk image file.
